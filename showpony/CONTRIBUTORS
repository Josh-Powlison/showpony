SHOWPONY.PHP

Showpony is set up to only make 1 file call on initial load. So you'll see CSS, JS, etc, all compiled into showpony.php.

For just one medium, here are all the files that would be called from the client side if it was all split up in a more typical way:
1. Showpony JS
2. Showpony PHP (called by Showpony JS)
3. Showpony CSS
4. Loading files (in initially requested language)
5. Subtitles call (if subtitles initially requested)
6. Module JS (* number of modules)
7. Module CSS (* number of modules)

This setup has a few benefits:
1. PHP can be run in JS and CSS files: this lets us customize display and functionality based on server data directly.
2. 1 server call instead of 5 + (Modules * 2): server calls are generally more expensive than bandwidth. This is meant to speed up the process.
3. Allows us to require just 1 line of code to run: we can pass $_GET info to PHP to retrieve all of the info immediately.

If you'd like to contest this setup, feel free to start up a discussion and let us know why you think an alternative setup would be more resource-efficient.

Thanks!
