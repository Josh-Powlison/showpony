00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
Narrator: You are listening to a recording of

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
The Adventures of Bob and Susie.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Susie: Bob! Get out of the toilet.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Narrator: Susie yelled at her friend.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.500
He thought just because he was older he could do whatever he wanted.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.00
Well- he couldn't.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Bob: Susie, can't you see? I dropped my dentures in there!

00:29.000 --> 00:30.500
Susie: I don't care.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.500
Bob: Well I do!

00:32.500 --> 00:37.000
Narrator: And that settled it. Bob was stubborn.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
Maybe that was why she loved him- stubborn was just a... turn-on for her.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Susie: Look, I don't like this. Mom told you not to reach into the toilet, Bob.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Bob: Well, I don't-

00:50.000 --> 00:51.500
Bob: (screaming)

00:51.500 --> 00:54.000
Narrator: A hand reached out of the toilet.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
Susie: Bob!
Narrator: -was all Susie managed to yell before Bob got pulled under.
Bob: (screaming and drowning)

01:00.000 --> 01:03.500
Susie had to do something. But what?

01:03.500 --> 01:05.5000
Susie got out the plunger.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
Susie: I'll save you, Bob!
Narrator: -she yelled.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
A hand reached out and grabbed the plunger.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.500
Susie: No!
Narrator: She said, annoyed.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.500
Susie: This can't be happening!

01:16.500 --> 01:19.000
The hand pulled. She pulled back.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
The hand pulled. She pulled back.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.500
The hand pulled.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.000
She forgot to resist.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Susie: (screaming and drowning)
