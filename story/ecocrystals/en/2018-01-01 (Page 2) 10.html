<p>"Whoaaaa!" Kiaral gawked from the other side.</p><p>Deemus pushed through the brush and came out into the large clearing where the ecocrystal lay, flat as the ground and mostly underground. The ecocrystal was a light red (Deemus insisted it wasn't pink) and, although chipped and beaten well on the top, was still very transparent so that you could see the light bouncing around inside and even get a glimpse of how far deep underground the ecocrystal went.</p><p>Kiaral took out her notepad and started jotting down all sorts of notes while looking around the area. Her eyes were bright and she hummed cheerily, and she happily showed Deemus the sketches she made.</p><p>Deemus was impressed by the sketches, but had seen the ecocrystal many times. It wasn't exciting to him.</p><p>"It's amazing that so many different types of ecocrystals exist. Woods, jungles, waterfalls, plains, oases, mountains... all sorts of beautiful environments around the ecocrystals. All separated by unbearably long desert." She sighed. "It would be great if all of these lands were joined and you could just walk between them, wouldn't you think?"</p><p>Deemus was about as excited about this conversation as a four-year-old gets about finances. "That would be great. The desert sucks."</p><p>"But the desert is beautiful too! I would never want to see the desert disappear completely. But inventors haven't perfected horseless chariots yet, and they can't figure out the right fuel, so we probably won't have a good way to travel between places and cities for at least another few decades."</p><p>"So why didn't you just wait on this little expedition/adventure until then?" Deemus swallowed a yawn, which made his eyes watery. This interested him more than her conversation.</p><p>"I couldn't wait that long. I have more dreams than just seeing the world, you know; I want to see the nations join together in trading and greater union. I want to see the world change. But I need to see the world before I can really change it."</p><p>Deemus failed to swallow the next yawn. "I don't think horseless chariots are possible."</p><p>Kiaral, seeming alarmed, shouted "WHAT?! I've seen little wind-up toys for children that can fly across the room across the ground? Yes. I've seen those become bigger, and bigger, and bigger? Yes! Are we even living in the same world?! Horseless chariots are the future!"</p><p>"The only way a horse will be useful though is if it's pulling a dopey little family in an extended chariot. You'd be making thousands of years of horse breeding irrelevant!"</p><p>"No we wouldn't, we would just find a new use for horses! Like maybe for stomping grapes for wine or something."</p><p>"...seriously?"</p><p>"Okay, maybe we'd use them for something else."</p><p>"My family has some of the best horses in the land. They wouldn't stand for it. They raise those horses for running long distances and pulling large families and their junk with them, not to sit around stomping the ground."</p><p>"...the horses wouldn't stand for it?"</p><p>"No, my family wouldn't; they wouldn't stand for a lot of things though."</p><p>Kiaral smiled, "The sage says, 'Habit is the enemy of progress, thus progress must become a habit.'" She went back to sketching. "How'd you get into the boar business? I thought that was a step down, but I could be wrong."</p><p>Deemus thought of lying again, but he thought better of it. He sighed. "My family and I didn't get along."</p><p>"I see. So you couldn't introduce me to some of the best horses in the land?"</p>
