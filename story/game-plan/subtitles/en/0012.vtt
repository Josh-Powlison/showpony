85.82,3.35 --> 96.99,15.27
Hmm... he seems familiar...

44.22,1.43 --> 57.38,12.05
Who's that?

-0.07,27.12 --> 13.22,41.6
That's Locke. Don't you recognize him?

63.62,37.09 --> 83.11,51.38
No, I've never met him before...
Hehehe...

1.21,47.38 --> 12.83,60.74
You rich kids...

81.87,86.92 --> 94.14,95.59
Huh...

4.14,79.72 --> 22.6,97.66
He knows all the good games.
He's skipping over the mediocre ones...
