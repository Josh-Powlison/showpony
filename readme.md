# What is Showpony?

An easy-to-use multimedia engine for telling stories in almost any medium online!

# What are some of its awesome features?

* Fullscreen: on any device, for any medium!
* Easy archives: go to the menu and just click and drag across the screen to go to any part quickly!
* Easy use: about 4 lines of JavaScript is all it takes to get Showpony working on your site!
* Admin system: update files from an easy-access admin setup! Can be easily disabled if you'd rather not deal with that.
* Mix media: video, comics, songs, books, and more can all be viewed in a streamlined experience!

# What media can I work in with Showpony?

Showpony is ready for:

* Comics
* Video
* Audio
* Straight HTML files

Although in the works are also:

* Visual Novels
* Kinetic Novels
* Interactive Fiction

And later:

* Screenplays
* Stageplays
* Videogames (will likely be limited)

## Is it performant?

This doesn't just depend on the code but on the resources you use and the files you use for your stories, but my bad laptop's handled it pretty well. Try it for your project and see!

Also, if you're concerned about size, uncompressed it's currently around 65 KB. Most engines for just one of the media Showpony supports are much larger.

## How's browser support?

It's made for modern browsers, but I can only test with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Chrome Mobile. Test it thoroughly for your own projects, and let me know if you run into any errors!

I do my best to guarantee it works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Chrome mobile. I am not attempting IE support but will try to support the newest versions of Edge. As I hear about Safari bugs I will do my best to patch those too.

## Can I make desktop applications with Showpony?

With something like [php-desktop](https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop) you can, although that has its own issues (doesn't support .mp3s, .mp4s, need to send the whole package for use). I don't have an official implementation out right now and have no plans to add one. If you want to fork one, let me know!

## I ran into a bug. I'm not a programmer. I am sad. Can you help?

Email me at joshuapowlison@gmail.com

## Showpony's missing a feature I can't live without and now I am dead.

Don't be dead! Email me at joshuapowlison@gmail.com

## What else do I have to install to get Showpony to work?

Nothing!- you don't even need Wordpress or jQuery! For some features you will need PHP but that comes preinstalled on most servers.

## How can I support Showpony's development?

A few ways, no obligation:

* State on your Showpony-using site that it's powered by Showpony and have a link coming back here or to [showpony.heybard.com]
* Tell others about Showpony
* Test Showpony out and send me bug reports by email (joshuapowlison@gmail.com) or on Twitter (@joshpowlison)
* Get involved as a programmer!
* Send me money and let me know it's for Showpony, and I'll try to put more hours towards it (since I can't make any promises, view this as a donation, not as payment)! https://www.paypal.me/joshpowlison
