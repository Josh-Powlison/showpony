## Can I use this on my website right now!

Absolutely, although it's still really in the works, so be careful and test thoroughly! Email me if you run into any problems.

## Can I sell or make money off works made with Showpony?

Absolutely! But you can't sell the code itself.

## How heavy is Showpony?

Uncompressed it's less than 75 KB.

This will obviously go up as I add features, but it will also go down as I continue to make it more performant, so it'll probably stay around that amount.

## Is it performant?

This doesn't just depend on the code but on the resources you use, but my bad laptop's handled it pretty well. Try it for your projects and see!

## How's browser support?

It's made for modern browsers, but I can only test with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Chrome Mobile. Test it thoroughly for your own projects, and let me know if you run into any errors!

I do my best to guarantee it works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Chrome mobile. I do not guarantee or attempt to support any versions of IE and try to support the newest versions of Edge.

## Can I make desktop applications with Showpony.

With something like php-desktop you can, although that has its own issues (doesn't support .mp3s, .mp4s, need to send the whole package for use). I don't have an official implementation out right now and have no plans to add one. If you want to fork one, let me know!

## I ran into a bug. I'm not a programmer. I am sad. Can you help?

Email me at joshuapowlison@gmail.com

## Showpony's missing a feature I can't live without and now I am dead.

Don't be dead! Email me at joshuapowlison@gmail.com

## What else do I have to install to get Showpony to work?

Nothing!- not even jQuery!

## How can I support Showpony's development?

A few ways, no obligation:

* State on your Showpony-using site that it's powered by Showpony and have a link coming back here or to [showpony.heybard.com]
* Tell others about Showpony
* Test Showpony out and send me bug reports by email (joshuapowlison@gmail.com) or on Twitter (@joshpowlison)
* Get involved as a programmer!
* Send me money and let me know it's for Showpony, and I'll try to put more hours towards it (since I can't make any promises, view this as a donation, not as payment)! https://www.paypal.me/joshpowlison
