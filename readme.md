# What is Showpony?

A multimedia UI. It comes with modules for text, comics, video, and more, with the option to add additional modules as you want.

# What are some of its awesome features?

* Fullscreen: on any device, for any medium!
* Easy archives: go to the menu and just drag across the screen to go to any part quickly!
* Easy install: 1 line of HTML will take care of you in most cases. No dependencies, you just need to be running PHP 7 or higher.
* Automatic bookmarks: both locally and remotely saved.
* Mix media: video, comics, songs, books, and more can all be viewed in a streamlined experience!
* Cross-device: supports touch screens, keyboard and mouse, and gamepads!
* Cross-browser: recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, including mobile versions!

# What media can I work in with Showpony?

Also in the works are:

* Interactive Fiction
