# What is Showpony?

The first online multimedia engine! Tell stories in any medium or across the media of your choice.

# What are some of its awesome features?

* Fullscreen: on any device, for any medium!
* Easy archives: go to the menu and just drag across the screen to go to any part quickly!
* Easy install: about 4 lines of JavaScript is all it takes to get a basic Showpony working on your site! No dependencies are required either (except PHP 7 for automatically grabbing and hiding files, which is likely already set up on your server), and Showpony comes in under 140 KB uncompressed.
* [Hey Bard! integration](https://github.com/Josh-Powlison/hey-bard-api): automatically save user bookmarks cross-browser and load them back!
* Preload files: so that users can have a smooth reading experience (text and comics only for now)
* Admin system: can be enabled to allow easy file updates!
* Mix media: video, comics, songs, books, and more can all be viewed in a streamlined experience!
* Cross-device: made to support touch screens as well as keyboard and mouse! Even supports gamepads!
* Cross-browser: tested in modern browsers: recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, including mobile versions!
