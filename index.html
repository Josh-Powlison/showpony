<h1>Showpony</h1>
<p>Showpony is a lightweight multimedia engine that makes uploading and updating your stories quick and easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Josh-Powlison/showpony" target="_blank">Download Showpony Here!</a></p>
<p>Go to the top-left corner of the engine to access the menu.</p>

<!--The only two files you need to directly call to get a Showpony object up-and-running!-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="showpony/styles.css">
<script src="showpony/script.js"></script>
	
<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3><a href="http://gameplanmanga.com" target="_blank">Game Plan! by Inkhana and Calbhach</a></h3>

<h3>Orbit by Josh Powlison</h3>

<div class="story" id="orbit"></div>
<script>
	window.addEventListener(
		"load"
		,function(){
			showponyOrbit=new Showpony({
				window:document.getElementById("orbit")
				,path:"examples/orbit/" //The path to the story files. Remember the slash!
				,info:"[n]<br>[2pc] | [2pl]"
				,query:"orbit"
				,start:0
				,title:"Orbit: [n] (Part [0pc])"
				,admin:true
				,object:"orbit.com"
			});
		}
	);
</script>

<h3>Sintel Trailer</h3>

<div class="story" id="sintel">
	<div id="sintel-splash" class="splash"><p>Click to play "Sintel Trailer"!</p></div>
</div>
<script>
	//We need to reapply the event listener afterwards, hence, the slightly trickier code
	function runSintel(){
		document.getElementById("sintel-splash").addEventListener(
			"click"
			,function(){

					window:document.getElementById("sintel")
					,path:"examples/sintel/" //The path to the story files. Remember the slash!

						showponySintel.close();
						runSintel();
					}
				);
			}
		);
	}
	
	runSintel();
</script>

<h3>Interactive Fiction/Visual Novel Test: Cat Store</h3>

<p>This is still very much a WIP. I can't recommend using Showpony for visual or kinetic novels yet. You will see some errors cross-browser too.</p>

<div class="story" id="cat-store">
	<div id="cat-store-splash" class="splash"><p>Click to play "Cat Store"!</p></div>
</div>
<script>
	//We need to reapply the event listener afterwards, hence, the slightly trickier code
	function runCatStore(){
		document.getElementById("cat-store-splash").addEventListener(
			"click"
			,function(){
				showponyCatStore=new Showpony({
					window:document.getElementById("cat-store")
					,path:"examples/cat-store/" //The path to the story files. Remember the slash!
					,info:""
					,query:false
					,start:0
				});
				
				showponyCatStore.window.addEventListener(
					"end"
					,function(){
						showponyCatStore.close();
						runCatStore();
					}
				);
			}
		);
	}
	
	runCatStore();
</script>

<p>Below is some sample code in use by the engine. Note that the syntax is still under development and is subject to change; I wouldn't recommend memorizing this syntax or anything.</p>

<h3>Kinetic Novel Test: Late to the Party</h3>

<p>This is still very much a WIP. I can't recommend using Showpony for this yet. You will see some errors cross-browser too.</p>

<p>This one is broken up into two parts. Currently you can see a "flash" (or a long pause) when moving between parts by progressing. I plan on fixing that.</p>

<div class="story" id="party">
	<div id="party-splash" class="splash"><p>Click to play "Late to the Party"!</p></div>
</div>
<script>
	//We need to reapply the event listener afterwards, hence, the slightly trickier code
	function runParty(){
		document.getElementById("party-splash").addEventListener(
			"click"
			,function(){
				showponyParty=new Showpony({
					window:document.getElementById("party")
					,path:"examples/late-to-the-party/" //The path to the story files. Remember the slash!
					,info:""
					,query:false
					,start:0
				});
				
				showponyParty.window.addEventListener(
					"end"
					,function(){
						showponyParty.close();
						runParty();
					}
				);
			}
		);
	}
	
	runParty();
	
</script>

<p>Below is some sample code in use by the engine. Note that the syntax is still under development and is subject to change; I wouldn't recommend memorizing this syntax or anything.</p>

<h2>Using Showpony</h2>

<p>You can put the files on your website and load the CSS and JS files to get Showpony working:</p>

<pre class="html">
<h3>HTML</h3>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="showpony/styles.css"&gt;
&lt;script src="showpony/script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;/*Load your script file, or put your JavaScript in here*/&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h3>1-Line Setup</h3>

<script>new Showpony</script>

<pre class="js">
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
new Showpony
</pre>

<p>Showpony will automatically:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Make a Showpony window. (It will be 480 pixels tall, and fill the width of whatever space it's put into)</li>
	<li>Get files from the "files" folder.</li>
	<li>Save and load the user's place (by reading the URL).</li>
	<li>Start the user from the final file (like most online webcomics do).</li>
</ol>

<p>Those options may sound perfect to you- if so, great! But if you want something a little different, don't worry- all of the above options can be overwritten. You'll need to customize Showpony further for that, which is fortunately really easy!</p>

<h3>Custom Setup</h3>

<p>We'll be using the same HTML and CSS as before, but adding a few options to the Showpony object:</p>

<div class="story" id="custom"></div>
<script>
	window.addEventListener(
		"load"
		,function(){
			showponyCustom=new Showpony({
				window:document.getElementById("custom")
					,files:[ //You can put the files in an array list if you don't want to use PHP
						"02 (Baby Goat).svg"
						,"03 (Gumballs).svg"
						,"04 (Sign-Put-Downer).svg"
						//,'another-file.jpg'
						//,'yet-another-file.jpg'
						//,'look-a-gif!.gif'
					]
					,path:"examples/orbit/"
					,scrubLoad:true
					,start:0
					,info:"Part [0pc]: [n]"
					,query:false
					,dateFormat:{
						year:"numeric"
						,month:"long"
						,day:"numeric"
						,hour:"numeric"
					}
			});
		}
	);
	
	//If you want to learn more advanced functionality of Showpony, go to https://github.com/Josh-Powlison/showpony/wiki
</script>

<pre class="js">
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
new Showpony({
	window:document.getElementById("showpony")
	,path:"examples/orbit/"
	,files:[
		"02 (Baby Goat).svg"
		,"03 (Gumballs).svg"
		,"04 (Sign-Put-Downer).svg"
	]
	,scrubLoad:true
	,start:0
	,info:"Part [0pc]: [n]"
	,query:false
	,dateFormat:{year:"numeric",month:"long",day:"numeric",hour:"numeric"}
});
</pre>

<p><strong>window</strong> is the div or element Showpony will display in.</p>

<p><strong>path</strong> is the path to the files you want Showpony to use, which will likely be a folder name followed by a slash.</p>

<p><strong>files</strong> is an array of the files you want to load from the <strong>path</strong> specified. This gives you more fine control over what files to load, but it won't automatically update as it will if you leave <strong>files</strong> out of the list. <em>Defaults to: 'get'.</em></p>

<p><strong>scrubLoad</strong> will load files as you scrub in the menu instead as opposed to only after you release. This can result in a nicer experience for users, but can also become slow and unnecessarily use up your server's resources. <em>Defaults to: false.</em></p>

<p><strong>start</strong> will determine where users start from. 0 will start you from the beginning, but you can also use any number or the value "last" to start from the last part. <em>Defaults to: "last".</em></p>

<p><strong>info</strong> sets the display of info in the menu. It has many special values:</p>

<ol>
	<li>[n] passed the filename</li>
	<li>[d] passes the current date</li>
	<li>[0pc], [0pl], [0pt] passes the current part, parts left, and parts total, respectively</li>
	<li>[0%c] and [0%l] passes the current percentage and percentage left, respectively</li>
	<li>[0hc], [0hl], [0ht] passes the current hour, hours left, and hours total, respectively</li>
	<li>[0mc], [0ml], [0mt] passes the current minute, minutes left, and minutes total, respectively</li>
	<li>[0sc], [0sl], [0st] passes the current second, seconds left, and seconds total, respectively</li>
</ol>

<p>The 0 before certain values can be changed to a number between 1 and 9. Up to that many leading zeroes will then precede that number [2pc] would show 01, while [4pc] would show 0001. <em>Defaults to "[0pc] | [0pl]"</em></p>

<p><strong>query</strong> sets whether to save the user's position in the URL, with something like "?part=2". You can use "name" to set the text in the URL to "?name=1", or set it to false to not use it at all. <em>Defaults to: "part".</em></p>

<p><strong>dateFormat</strong> sets the format of dates in info. This object is passed directly to an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat" target="_blank"> the Intl.DateTimeFormat</a> object's options. Look under "Syntax", "Parameters", "options" at the link for more info. <em>Defaults to {year:"numeric",month:"numeric",day:"numeric"}</em></p>

<h3>This Showpony knows a few tricks...</h3>

<p>You can do more with Showpony too: it fires events, has a built-in admin panel, and more! If you want to get into those pieces, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/Josh-Powlison/showpony/wiki" target="_blank">Wiki</a> on Github!</p>

<h3>Other questions</h3>

<p>If you want a place to load Showpony from my website, I don't currently have a recommended link- I'll be updating my own files without warning fairly regularly and assuming you've got copies on your own site so that won't affect you.</p>

<p>If I'm at a place where there's a good, stable version, and you'd like to just load the files from my site, shoot me an email at joshuapowlison@gmail.com! I don't think I'd have a problem with that; if I do at the time, I'll let you know, but ask 'cause I probably can!</p>
