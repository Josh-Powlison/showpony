<p>Deemus tensed. "No."</p><p>Kiaral leaned into Deemus's face, trying to make a cute expression. "I want to see them."</p><p>"No."</p><p>Kiaral scowled and backed away. "You mean they wouldn't be interested in meeting a foreigner who had her life saved by their brave and handsome son?"</p><p>Deemus flushed. "Stop, that's cheating, I'm easily flattered and yes, I am brave and handsome."</p><p>Kiaral leaned in again, "It would make my trip twice as good! And you'd get extra money for seeing me to their home."</p><p>"I... that's a terrible idea."</p><p>Kiaral sighed, fell back onto the ground, "I'm going to add a note to my notebook." She took it out and began scrawling. "'A man named Deemus has a family who has great horses that he'll refuse to show me, even though it would result in more money and he wouldn't even have to take me further than where I could see their house.'"</p><p>The crossbowman's words echoed through Deemus's mind: "They're good people but remember everything." He clenched his fists, saying through gritted teeth, "I'll take you."</p><p>Kiaral's eyes glittered like the ecocrystal in the sunlight, "Really?!"</p><p>"Absolutely. I'm an heir to the place anyway. At least, I think I still am."</p><p>Kiaral got up and surprised Deemus with a tight hug, "Oh, thank you!"</p><p>Deemus grimaced and blushed simultaneously. Grimaced because he still smelled like toad poop, blushed because he had begun to not-so-secretly (and he knew it) like her. "...you owe me."</p><p>Kiaral laughed, "You'll be well-funded."</p><p>Deemus had to admit, he was a little happier about the money than about being with her longer. But he waved that away as not a problem, because he also felt a little guilty about that.</p><p>Kiaral ran around to the other side of the ecocrystal and began taking more notes, "I'll let you know when I'm ready to go!"</p>
