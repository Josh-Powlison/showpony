<p>Kiaral stepped forward, and yelled back, "Hail fellow! We are running from an ogre."</p><p>The crossbowman moaned, "Deemus! What kind of adventures are you pulling others into now, and especially a foreigner!"</p><p>Deemus stated defensively, "As soon as the ogre looked our way, I knew we had to bolt. I had to protect this young traveler-"</p><p>The crossbowman facepalmed and muttered, "The ogre won't chase you unless you provoked it... gah, Deemus, what kind of nonsense are you putting into this young lady's head?"</p><p>"Non-nonsense, fair sir."</p><p>"What are you doing out here anyway?"</p><p>Kiaral bowed, "Deemus is helping me find the ecocrystal, which I presume is straight ahead. I'm a tourist who wants to see it and all the other ecocrystals in the world." She removed a small journal from a pocket sewn into her dress, "I've been keeping notes on all of my travels, and sketches, and can't wait to learn what all the world has to offer!" Her excitement was infectious, except to Deemus, who didn't care.</p><p>From atop the tower, "Don't you know we have tour guides that go out once a week? You'd have been better going out with anybody besides Deemus."</p><p>Deemus scowled. "I'd disagree, if you weren't already so obviously wrong."</p><p>Kiaral spoke, "I only have a week to visit each location. I might return here later, but I couldn't schedule the tour properly, unfortunately." She looked down at the ground, seemingly embarrassed.</p><p>"You and Deemus go see the ecocrystal. Just the obvious rules: don't take any chunks from it, don't take any shards of it you find, and don't litter or disrespect the premises. If I find you breaking any rules, I'll give a shout if you didn't know that one and escort you out of the Ogre Woods if you did."</p><p>Kiaral clapped her hands together, "Thank you!" She ran past the tower through the brush ahead.</p><p>"And Deemus!"</p><p>Deemus looked up at the crossbowman, who was smiling. "Don't do anything stupid. She's from the Waterfall; I can tell by her accent and hair. They're good people but remember everything."</p><p>"What are you trying to tell me?"</p><p>"Don't do anything you want her to remember. Like you already have." He chuckled, "Lying about ogres to a tourist, really? You don't think she's done her own research on them?"</p><p>Deemus sighed, but couldn't snap back for fear of Kiaral hearing.</p>
